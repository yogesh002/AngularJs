# Promises in AngularJs

This example demonstrates how <strong>Promises</strong> in AngularJs can be chained together using <strong>then</strong> keyword. The only problem with this method is : <br>
<ul>
    <li>It is not easier to read the codes since all promises are chained to one another.</li>
    <li>There is error handling function in each promise.</li>
    <li>No parallel execution of promises is happening. One promise waits for another to complete</li>
</ul>
